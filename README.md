# Cursorphobic

inspired by [FireShell](http://getfireshell.com)
Fiercely quick front-end boilerplate and workflows.

The opinionated FastShell framework. Built for the modern developer. For teams and the individual, encouraging a better workflow. JavaScript task running, build processes, autominification and file concatenation, wrapped with an enhanced HTML5 boilerplated framework.
